> asteroid-geometry.js
An a-frame geometry component that contains a better-looking asteroid, registered as "asteroid-geometry", which you can use in your entities.
It also doubles up as an example as how to use THREE methods to generate geometry and use it inside a-frame entities.

> asteroid-explode-shader.js
An example a-frame shader registration, with a vertex/fragment shader combo that "explodes" polys with regards to a previously computed "displacement". (see setupExplosion() definition on asteroid-geometry.js)
